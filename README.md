## 👨‍💻 Profile

I am a Computer Science and Cybersecurity student focused on building real-world software systems rather than only academic programs.
My projects aim to demonstrate practical understanding of:

* Secure system design
* Web application development
* Embedded and IoT automation
* Trust and communication between devices and users

I am especially interested in backend engineering, security concepts, and system architecture.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔐 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate Authority

A web-based Certificate Authority that issues, verifies, and revokes digital certificates using public-key cryptography.

This project demonstrates how browsers establish trust with HTTPS websites and how compromised certificates are invalidated.

**Key Concepts Implemented**

* RSA-2048 key generation
* Digital signature verification
* Certificate validation
* Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
* Authentication & integrity verification
